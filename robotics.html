		<p><strong>DESCRIPTION: </strong>The purpose of this course is to help students master science, technology, engineering and mathematics principles while building critical thinking skills and creative problems solving skills that will serve them for a lifetime. STEM Robotics teaches 21st century skill sets like time management, resource allocation, teamwork, and communications. Students will be encouraged to explore their talents and to work hands-on to master STEM skills through practical experience, integrating the LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT robotics building systems, and Robot C, an industry-standard programming language developed by Carnegie Mellon University. Students will have the opportunity to build and program robots to solve real-world problems and compete in an in-class robotics competition.</p>

				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>ROBOTC is a powerful C-based programming language with a Windows environment for writing and debugging programs. ROBOTC allows students to learn the type of c-based programming used in advanced education and professional applications</p>

				<p>With LEGO MINDSTORMS students can build robots and use software to plan, test and modify sequences of instructions from a variety of real life robotic behaviors. They gather and analyze data from sensors using data logging functionalities such as graph view. Robotics is an exciting way to bring science, technology, engineering and mathematics to a classroom. </p>
