		<p><strong>Goal : </strong>The US Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts one in every two STEM jobs in the country will be in computing occupations, with more than 150,000 job openings annually making it one of the fastest growing occupations in the United States. And these jobs pay 75% more than the national median annual salary. Finally, the breadth of industries requiring computing professionals is diverse -- two-thirds of computing jobs are in sectors other than information technology, including manufacturing, defense, health care, finance, and government.</p>

				<h2>LEARN HOW TO THINK</h2>
				<p>"<em>I think everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer because it teaches you how to think.</em>" - <strong>Steve Jobs</strong></p>

				<p>According to <em>code.org, </em>computer science develops students' computational and critical thinking skills and shows them how to create, not simply use, new technologies. This fundamental knowledge is needed to prepare students for the 21st century, regardless of their ultimate field of study or occupation.</p>
